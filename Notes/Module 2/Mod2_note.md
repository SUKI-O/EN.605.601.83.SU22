# Project life Cycle
## Pure Waterfall Model
- Sequential
- phase
    - Moves on despite not complete
- Momemtum prob
## Modified Waterfall Model
- Check Points

- Need to spec at the beginning 
- Hard to modify
- Cant be delivered until finish

## Staged Delievery 
- Can be delivered incrementally
- Need minimum dependacy
    - Prioritize features 

## Design to Schedule Model
- Features priorotization
    - deadlines: not set delievery

## Prototyping Models
### Rapid Prototyping Model

### Evolutionary Prototyping Model
- Doesn't work with deadlines

## Spiral Model
- Rist mitigation
- Iteration until all risks are addressed
- Cons: complicated

## **Iterative** vs **Incremental** model

**iterative**: repeated many times
**incremental**: each releese contains additoinal features
### Unified Process Life Cycle (IBM)
    - specs need not predefiend
    - work with dealline
    - scalable

- Kanban
    - Kanban Board
    - Just in Time delivery
    - Not time boxed
